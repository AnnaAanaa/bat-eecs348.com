(1) Is there a fault in the program? If so, locate it.
x[i] % 2 == 1 || x[i] > 0

because it does not count negative odd numbers.

it should be

x[i] % 2 != 0 || x[i] > 0

(2) If possible, define a test case that does not execute the fault.
input : {} Null
expected output : 0
actual output : 0


(3) If possible, define a test case that executes the fault but does not result in an error state.
input : {1,2,3}
expected output : 3
actual output : 3

(4) If possible, define a test case that results in an error, not failure.
there can't be an error and not a failure. the only way to induce an error would require a negative number in the array which will in turn cause a failure.

(5) If possible, define a test case that results in failure.
input : {-3, -2, -1}
expected output : 2
actual output : 0
